# git-demo

This repository contains a PlantUML sequence diagram that illustrates the basic Git commands and their interactions.

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you have PlantUML installed on your machine. If not, you can download it from [here](http://plantuml.com/starting).
2. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
3. Open the file `git-sequence-diagram.puml` in PlantUML.
4. You can now view the diagram and make any changes as per your requirement.

## Understanding the Diagram

The diagram illustrates the interactions between a user and Git, and the various commands that can be executed by the user. It shows the flow of the Git commands and their usage. It also shows how a user interacts with both local and remote repositories.

The diagram uses different arrow types to indicate the flow of the commands, with a solid arrow indicating the primary flow and a dotted arrow indicating a secondary action. It also uses activation bars to indicate when an object is performing an action, and deactivation bars to indicate when it has finished.

The diagram is useful for understanding the basic Git commands and their usage, and also for illustrating the concept of remote and local repositories.
